# Rice Image Classification Using MobileNetV2

## Project Overview

This project aims to classify rice grain images into five distinct categories using deep learning, specifically leveraging the **MobileNetV2** architecture. It utilizes the publicly available *Rice Image Dataset* from Kaggle, comprising 75,000 images of five rice types.

## Technical Highlights

* **Model Architecture**: MobileNetV2 (transfer learning with `imagenet` weights)
* **Dataset**: [Rice Image Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muratkokludataset/rice-image-dataset)
* **Augmentation**: ImageDataGenerator with zoom, rotation, flip, and brightness adjustments
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report
* **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn-based performance plots and sample previews

## Purpose and Applications

* Demonstrate effective rice grain classification using deep learning
* Assist in automated sorting/grading in agriculture and food industries
* Educational resource for image classification using TensorFlow and Keras
